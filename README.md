### BDD
  As a user, I would like to;  
  1. Efficiently use the website across devices of all sizes and browsers.
  1. See each of the **'What we do'**  icons toggle between the respective description when clicked, with both the header(also bold) and description center aligned.  
  1. Create a hover effect for each of the **Portfolio** projects - a white box should appear with the project name inside while the project picture is still visible in the background.
  1. Submit a message capturing my name, my email and the message and get an alert that my message has been received.
  1. Ensure all inputs are validated before submission and all form fields are cleared after submission.
  1. Have a seperate Business logic and UI logic.
