  1. Create a hover effect for each of the Portfolio projects - a white box should appear with the project name inside while the project picture is stil visible in the background.
  1. Submit a message capturing my name, my email and the message - all inputs should be validated before submission.
  1. Get an alert that my message has been received and the form fields cleared.
  1. Have a seperate Business logic and UI logic.
